#the weatherman 

nobody knows why the garden grows\
why the rain falls or why the wind blows\
nobody knows where the river flows\
why the clouds float or where they go

nobody knows why the moon glows\
or why the sun shines whenever it shows\
why the world shivers whenever it snows\
or what makes earth quakes and floods and tornados

why the birds fly or why they land\
why the fish swim or why the trees stand\
nobody knows because nobody can\
nobody but the weatherman
