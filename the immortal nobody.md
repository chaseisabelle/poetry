# the immortal nobody

crazy is the life\
that you live and don't regret\
when you forgive but can't forget\
who will save your soul?

when everyone you've known\
has left you all alone\
you become one of the unknown\
who will save your soul?

when you realize fatality\
a victim of immortality\
will you refuse to end it sadly?\
you will save your soul
