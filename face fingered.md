# face fingered

blood stained fingers and mucusy clothes\
why do these pickers pick their nose?\
didn't their mamas ever love them\
or the man in the sky up above them?

is it natural instinct?  who taught this trade?\
they pick, look, and smile at what their nose made\
they pick with such force; yet, delicately\
and chomp on those snots like a delicacy

lovers may bleed from the prick of a rose\
fighters will bleed from knuckles and toes\
but, rather bleed than blow, there are those\
who would dare raise a finger, and pick the nose
