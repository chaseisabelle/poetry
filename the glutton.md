# the glutton

I don't eat by the rules!\
I eat what I want!\
My shirt sports spaghetti stains\
and I got a belly I can flaunt.

When I want food\
I can't wait in line all day,\
I make people move\
and pull my chair to the buffet.

I eat any kind of cake,\
chocolate, funnel, or pan.\
Wrapped my finger in bacon\
and took a bite off my hand.

I'm a Fruity Pebble rebel\
built Cocoa Puff tough.\
I eat pop rock salads with gravy\
until my face is double-stuffed.

I get hungry at 9,\
and eat until 10,\
and by 10:07,\
I'm hungry again.

I eat sushi and cannolis\
while I lust for burritos\
smothered in ranch dressing\
and syrup on my Doritos.

I feast like a king\
and pillage the table\
lay waste to the desert tray\
conquer the soup with a golden ladle.

They call me rude,\
they call me crude,\
they call me the dude\
who ate all their food.
