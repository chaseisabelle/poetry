#mt kilamanjaro pissed off my mom

mt. kilimanjaro just sits there\
like a big pile of dirt\
mocking me like Gucci Mane\
in a new Gucci shirt

an alien flying through space\
with both shoes untied\
hunting the human race\
for an alien bride

love censored by pride\
death wishing it'd died\
the saints living their lies\
rolling down the mountain sides

nervous and impatient\
the hunt becomes the slaughter\
proud to be insane\
the son becomes the daughter

the dogs won't stop barking\
the zombies rock to metallica\
Ramiro jam-scams Pebbles\
and a squirrel totals a celica

don't ever forget\
but always forgive\
live to love\
and you will love to live

trapped in trance\
as your mom practiced karate\
on the neighbor's face\
while he clogged the potty

over by the pool\
selling gravy by the ounce\
we don't want your lunch money\
we want all your allowance
