# bad mouth

back in the day we were friends. that's true\
i got to admit that i've still got love for you\
but when you were gone'd you weren't someone i thought i'd miss\
when we were kids whoever thought it'd end like this?

i guess you got the wrong people mad\
but still - no one deserves to die like that\
in the end you must've known it was all or nothing\
mom and dad choulda seen this one coming

that's why i gotta admit i never wanted you dead
