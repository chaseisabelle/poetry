# cherry picking

i can't say i never loved her\
especially, after all, i did\
but what could feel right? 16's not grown up\
we were only kids\
i was born a boy\
will i die a man?\
she's not evil, she's just a girl\
who wants some virgin nuts

don't let love make a fool of a good boy\
sex is just for fun\
"that girl will make a man of you"\
but a first times only once\
i was born a boy\
and i'll die a man\
i can't blame her and who can shame her\
for wanting what she wants

cologne and mints - suggesting hints\
should i give a fuck as all?\
all we were was shadows on the wall\
all it was was whispers in the hall
