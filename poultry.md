# poultry

chickens are food because they are dumb\
they aren't like you, or me, or anyone\
they cannot build machines that push and pull\
all that they do is make our bellies full

what did this chicken know before it died?\
before it's head was chopped off and it's body deep fried?\
if it could read books and get smart some how\
i wonder what this chicken would think of us now
