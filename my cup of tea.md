#my cup of tea

sometimes wild, sometimes mild\
sometimes spicy beautiful\
i sip and smile, forever and a while\
because my cup is always full\
full of love, bountiful thereof\
candied ambrosia to my lips\
drinking the tea that's drinking me\
a symbiotic apocalypse\
rebirthed on earth with each drops worth\
the love is warm honey on my soul\
each sip is my last, as each is my first\
until my cup is as empty as i am old
