you can't stay focused and you can't sit still\
too much tv is gonna make you kill\
it's just your mind trying to poison your brain\
take two a day and you'll be normal again

they live for money, and power, and fame\
they'll tell you halo's just a video game\
while they're plugging their controllers in the back of your head\
but in real life there's no respawn after you're dead

the menace is the promise that will never be\
that you can't escape the weight of gravity\
you can never understand and you can never complain\
and you won't go far in life if you're going insane

there must be somethin'-somethin' that we already know\
some kind of intuitive reasoning for it all\
but if you're searching for the truth then there's nothing to find\
and if you're searching for yourself then you're out of your mind

so i smoke marijuana and it's alright\
smoke marijuana and it's alright\
smoke marijuana and it's alright\
that marijuana, it's alright
