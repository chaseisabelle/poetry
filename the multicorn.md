#the multicorn

once upon a time\
far far away\
it lived sad and lonely\
and wept every day

sad because it was lonely\
lonely for it was the only\
unicorn that was born\
with more than one horn

the other unicorns taunted\
they teased and they scorned\
the sad, lonely horsey\
for having more than one horn

the sad, lonely horse\
couldn't feel much worse\
so, it galloped off to yonder\
where it went... 

...hmm... 

...i wonder...
