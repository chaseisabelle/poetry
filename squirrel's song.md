# squirrel's song

why do you lie there, fur, blood, and bones?\
i guess you didn't run fast enough home\
thought that you could out-run a jetta\
thought you'd cheat death but death wouldn't let ya

so, sad is the forest that knew your name\
sad are your squirrel babies that will never see you again\
but, let them know you did not die in vane\
no, you died in the fast lane

soon will come a man, with a scoop and a box\
and scrape your squirrel carcus off the hot, black rock\
and pull down the eye lids on your little squirrel face\
and lay you to rest in a better place

now i know why you lie there, flattened on your back\
with your smile in the shape of a tire track\
so, I say a prayer for the squirrel that i mourn\
that heaven is filled with a bunch of 8-corns
