# terrible and awful

he doesn't like the thoughts\
that children think\
he doesn't like the dreams\
that they dream\
doesn't like the songs\
that children sing\
doesn't like the joy\
that they bring\
he says he lives\
a terrible and awful life\
one that only\
he could survive\
it is his hell\
to everyday try\
when there is a million\
ways to die\
a billion ways to lose\
to give in\
to give up\
to realize\
death is the only reason\
he is alive
