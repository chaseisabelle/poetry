bad\
i never thought myself as it\
just another fucked up kid\
just another nut in the shit\
doing what i can to\
fuck with better people just to bring them...

down\
a place i never thought i'd go\
but here i am stuck in a hole\
i wonder how i got so low\
but i've got a great escape\
i get this stuff from blank it makes me...

feel like i wanna feel\
and when i put it in myself it makes me\
feel how i wanna feel\
and when i can't take anymore from it i\
give it up and steal\
but when i realize all it is it's just\
an easy way out

fucked\
caught in quite a predicament\
my mind is gone and i don't know where it went\
i feel i've lost my only friend\
maybe it found god and\
decided that it's better off in...

hell\
a place that i have never been\
and never wanna be again\
but look at the world we're in\
but i've got a great escape\
i get this stuff from blank it makes me...

feel like i wanna feel\
and when i put it in myself it makes me\
feel how i wanna feel\
and when i've given all i can it takes with\
force from all i steal\
but when i realize what it is it's just\
an easy way out
