#trojan man

there was a day he could have been a dad\
memories with children he never had\
pass through his mind like ghosts\
of children who died the most\
who had not even experienced existence\
except as a thought fading in a distance\
lives that could have been; however, were never\
like an eternal echo, dying slowly forever\
the echo of a scream drowned to a whisper\
once full of dreams, now merely a wisher
